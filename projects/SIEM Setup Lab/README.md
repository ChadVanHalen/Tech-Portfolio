# SIEM Deployment & Detection Engineering Lab

## üîç Project Overview
This hands-on project demonstrates end-to-end deployment and configuration of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Splunk Enterprise. The lab covers infrastructure setup, log ingestion, detection rule creation, and dashboard development to monitor for security threats like brute-force attacks.
