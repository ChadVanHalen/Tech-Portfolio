# Security Operations & Visualization

## Project Overview
This phase focuses on operationalizing security monitoring through advanced visualization, dashboard creation, and security analytics. The implementation transforms raw log data into actionable security intelligence, enabling proactive threat hunting and operational awareness.

## Technical Specifications
- Visualization Platform: Splunk Enterprise Dashboards
- Data Sources: Enriched SSH authentication logs
- Key Components: Statistical charts, time-based analytics, operational dashboards

# Implementation Walkthrough

## 1. Security Data Visualization Development
Created statistical visualizations to identify attack patterns and trends:
```bash
# SSH Failure Analysis Visualization
index=test sourcetype=linux_secure "sshd" "failed"
| timechart count by src_ip
```

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 AU-6 (Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting)
- CIS Controls 6.6 (Audit Log Monitoring and Analysis)

## 2. Operational Dashboard Implementation
Built comprehensive security dashboard for real-time monitoring:

Dashboard Components:
- Real-time SSH failure counters
- Source IP geographic mapping
- Time-series attack pattern analysis
- Top targeted usernames
- Success vs. failure rate monitoring

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 SI-4 (System Monitoring)
- GDPR Article 33 (Breach Notification Timeliness)

## 3. Time-Series Attack Pattern Analysis
Implemented temporal analysis to identify brute-force campaign patterns:
```bash
# Attack Pattern Correlation
index=test sourcetype=linux_secure "sshd" "failed"
| bucket _time span=1h
| stats count by _time, src_ip
| sort -count
```
Key Insights Generated:
- Identification of coordinated attack waves
- Recognition of automated vs. manual attack patterns
- Detection of source IP rotation tactics
- Time-of-day attack frequency analysis

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 SI-4 (System Monitoring)
- CIS Controls 6.7 (Audit Log Review)

## 4. Geographic Threat Intelligence Integration
Enhanced detection with spatial analysis capabilities:
- Mapped attack sources to geographic locations
- Identified regional threat concentrations
- Correlated time zones with attack patterns
- Established baseline for normal geographic distribution

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 SI-4 (Threat Awareness)
- CIS Controls 13 (Data Protection)

## 5. Multi-Vector Attack Correlation
Developed cross-signature detection for sophisticated threats:
```bash
# Multi-dimensional Attack Analysis
index=test sourcetype=linux_secure 
| eval attack_score = case(
    like(_raw, "%failed%"), 1,
    like(_raw, "%invalid%"), 1,
    like(_raw, "%authentication%"), 1,
    true(), 0
)
| stats sum(attack_score) as total_risk by src_ip, user
| where total_risk > 3
```

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 SI-4 (System Monitoring)
- GDPR Article 32 (Security Risk Assessment)

## 6. Security Metrics and Reporting
Established quantifiable security measures:

Operational Metrics:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) SSH attacks
- False positive/negative rates
- Attack volume trends
- Security control effectiveness

Compliance Metrics:
- Log collection completeness
- Detection rule coverage
- Incident response readiness
- Framework control alignment

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 PM-6 (Performance Measures)
- GDPR Article 5(2) (Accountability)

## 7. Proactive Threat Hunting Capabilities
Implemented advanced search patterns for unknown threats:
```bash
# Anomaly Detection Baseline
index=test sourcetype=linux_secure
| bucket _time span=1d
| stats count as daily_attempts by _time
| eventstats avg(daily_attempts) as avg_attempts, stdev(daily_attempts) as stdev_attempts
| eval z_score = (daily_attempts - avg_attempts) / stdev_attempts
| where z_score > 2
```
### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 SI-4 (System Monitoring)
- CIS Controls 6.8 (Audit Log Anomaly Detection)

## 8. Operational Procedure Documentation
Created comprehensive operational guidance:

Documentation Delivered:
- Dashboard interpretation procedures
- Alert triage and escalation workflows
- Detection rule maintenance schedules
- Incident response playbooks
- Compliance reporting templates

### Compliance Alignment:
- NIST 800-53 IR-4 (Incident Handling)
- GDPR Article 30 (Records of Processing Activities)
