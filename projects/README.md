# üìÅ Project Portfolio

Welcome to the full list of my hands-on security projects. These labs reflect my progression from IT into cybersecurity, with a growing focus on cloud security (aligned with GDPR, NIST, CIS), threat detection, and defensive experimentation.

## üåü Featured Project

### üîê [AWS Cloud Security Lab: GDPR, NIST & CIS VPC Hardening](https://github.com/ChadVanHalen/Tech-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AWS%20VPC%20Hardening%20NIST%20CIS%20Compliance/README.md)

A complete end-to-end AWS security lab designed around industry frameworks (GDPR, NIST 800-53 & CIS Benchmarks).  
‚úÖ IAM least-privilege roles  
‚úÖ Secure subnets, NACLs, SGs  
‚úÖ Flow logging, GuardDuty integration  
‚úÖ Automated guardrails for misconfig detection

> ‚≠ê This is my flagship cloud security project‚Äîbuilt to simulate real-world compliance hardening.
