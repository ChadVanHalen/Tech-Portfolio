# üîê IAM Privilege Escalation Lab - The "Oops, I Can Do More Than I probably Should" Story

Welcome to the world of IAM misconfigurations, where one little permission slip can snowball into a full admin takeover. In this lab, we‚Äôll explore how a seemingly innocent `iam:PassRole` privilege can let a lowly user escalate themselves to admin powers faster than you can say ‚Äúleast privilege.‚Äù

Spoiler alert: it doesn‚Äôt always end well for your cloud security posture.

## üß† Objective

- Create a misconfigured IAM policy that allows passing a highly privileged role
- Use that policy to escalate permissions and create a Lambda function as the ‚Äúbad actor‚Äù
- Attempt to invoke the Lambda function to test further escalation
- Observe where missing permissions stop the attacker (thanks, defense in depth!)
- Fix the policy and explain the importance of least privilege principles

| 2    | Create a malicious IAM policy (`policy-bad.json`) allowing `iam:PassRole` and Lambda creation |
| 3    | Create a user with this over-permissioned policy and CLI access                               |
| 4    | Upload a dummy Lambda function (`lambda_function.py`) as this user                            |
| 5    | Try invoking the Lambda function to see if you can run code                                   |
| 6    | Hit an `AccessDenied` error ‚Äî privilege escalation is incomplete                              |

## üí° Lessons Learned
- `iam:PassRole` is dangerous when combined with overly permissive role targets ‚Äî attackers can escalate privileges easily
- Creating resources is not the same as executing them: Even with `lambda:CreateFunction`, invocation requires additional permissions
- Defense in depth matters: Missing permissions elsewhere prevented full compromise, illustrating layered security controls
- Least privilege is your friend: Always restrict `PassRole` resources and add conditions to limit which roles can be passed
- Detection & remediation: Use IAM Access Analyzer and CloudTrail to find and fix overly broad policies

---

# üîö Summary
In this lab, we saw how one seemingly small misconfiguration ‚Äî granting iam:PassRole too broadly ‚Äî can open a door to privilege escalation, allowing a user to create privileged resources like Lambda functions. But, thanks to layered IAM policies and least privilege, the attacker couldn‚Äôt fully exploit this to invoke the function and run arbitrary code.

It‚Äôs a great reminder that no single control is perfect, but defense in depth and careful permission scoping are your best friends when it comes to cloud security.
