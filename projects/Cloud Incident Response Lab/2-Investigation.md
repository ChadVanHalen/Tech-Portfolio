üïµÔ∏è Step 2: Investigation
üéØ Objective
Investigate the GuardDuty alert using:

GuardDuty finding details

CloudTrail logs

IAM activity

EC2 instance metadata (if needed)

üß≠ Investigation Flow
‚úÖ 1. Start with the GuardDuty Finding
Go to GuardDuty > Findings, click on the crypto alert, and collect the following:

‚õ≥ Key Fields to Document:
Field	Description
Finding Type	Should be CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B!DNS
Resource ID	EC2 instance ID
Account ID	Your AWS account number
Region	Should be us-east-2
Instance Details	Includes public IP, tags, and launch time
Action	Should show DnsRequestAction and queried domain (e.g., xmr.crypto-pool.fr)
Time of Finding	Time GuardDuty flagged the activity
Severity	Likely "Medium" or "High"
Threat Purpose	"Unauthorized resource usage"

üìù Save this as a JSON file or screenshot for documentation.

‚úÖ 2. Use CloudTrail to Trace Initial Compromise
Go to CloudTrail > Event history and filter:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Event source: ec2.amazonaws.com
Event name: RunInstances
Username: crypto-actor
Look for the RunInstances call from the over-permissioned IAM user.

‚õ≥ Key Fields:
Field	Value
Event time	When EC2 was launched
Source IP	Should reflect the VPN (foreign IP)
User identity	Should show the crypto-actor IAM user
Region	Should be us-east-2
Request parameters	AMI, instance type, key name
Response elements	Instance ID (i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx)

üìù Export or copy the log entry to your artifacts folder.

‚úÖ 3. Investigate IAM Access
Still in CloudTrail, search for:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Event name: CreateAccessKey
Username: crypto-actor
Then:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Event name: AttachUserPolicy or PutUserPolicy
Username: crypto-actor
‚õ≥ What you‚Äôre confirming:
Who created the crypto-actor IAM user and when

Whether AdministratorAccess was attached manually

Any suspicious policy changes or console logins

üìù Document this timeline:

IAM user created

Access key generated

Permissions granted

EC2 instance launched

GuardDuty alert triggered

‚úÖ 4. Optional: Check EC2 Metadata (Advanced Attribution)
If you want to simulate deeper attacker behavior, SSH back into the EC2 instance and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
This shows what credentials the instance has ‚Äî if an attacker exfiltrated this and used it elsewhere, GuardDuty would raise an InstanceCredentialExfiltration alert.

For now, it‚Äôs just useful to understand what IAM role or profile (if any) the instance has.
