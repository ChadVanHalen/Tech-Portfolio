# üîç Investigation Report

## Summary
GuardDuty detected that an EC2 instance made DNS queries to a known crypto mining domain (`xmr.crypto-pool.fr`). The instance was launched by a compromised IAM user (`crypto-actor`) with excessive permissions.

## üìÜ Timeline of Events (All times in MDT)
- **15:17** ‚Äì IAM user `crypto-actor` was created and granted AdministratorAccess
- **15:19** ‚Äì Access key was created for the user
- **16:26** ‚Äì Attacker (via compromised keys) launched a t2.micro EC2 instance in us-east-2
- **~16:30‚Äì16:45** ‚Äì Suspicious activity simulated from the EC2 instance (DNS to crypto mining domain)
- **17:02** ‚Äì GuardDuty generated a finding: EC2 queried a Bitcoin-related domain (`xmr.crypto-pool.fr`)

## Findings

### GuardDuty
- **Finding Type:** CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B!DNS
- **Instance ID:** i-0123456789abcdef0
- **Domain Queried:** xmr.crypto-pool.fr
- **Source IP:** `18.220.214.60`

### CloudTrail
- **RunInstances call** by `crypto-actor`
- **Source IP:** `18.116.35.29`
- **Region:** us-east-2

### IAM
- `crypto-actor` created and given AdministratorAccess
- Access key used for CLI access and EC2 launch

## Initial Assessment
The attack vector appears to be:
1. Over-permissioned IAM user
2. Credential exposure (possibly hardcoded or leaked)
3. Attacker launched an EC2 instance to mine crypto
