# Terraform Security Templates + S3 Misconfiguration Lab â€” Concept
## Overview
A hands-on lab focused on terraforming secure AWS infrastructure with an emphasis on detecting and remediating common misconfigurations, especially around S3 buckets (e.g., public exposure, lack of encryption, improper ACLs).

## Use Case
- Simulate insecure Terraform templates that provision S3 buckets with risky configurations (public read/write, missing encryption).
- Detect these misconfigurations using tools like AWS Config Rules, Terraform Sentinel (or open source alternatives), and Terraform plan/diff scanning tools.
- Investigate and remediate by updating Terraform code and applying secure templates.
- Teach secure IaC (Infrastructure as Code) practices to avoid cloud security missteps.

## Core Learning Objectives
- Learn Terraform basics with AWS resources.
- Identify S3 bucket misconfigurations via Terraform code and AWS scanning tools.
- Practice remediating insecure configurations in IaC before deployment.
- Understand continuous compliance via Terraform policy-as-code.

## Suggested Tools & Services
- Terraform CLI + AWS Provider
- AWS S3
- AWS Config Rules (managed rules for S3 bucket encryption, public access blocks)
- Terraform Sentinel (if licensed) or Open Policy Agent (OPA) + Conftest as open alternatives
- Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (optional, for policy enforcement)
- Static code analysis tools like tfsec, checkov, or terrascan

| Step | Description                                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create intentionally insecure Terraform S3 bucket templates                                   |
| 2    | Deploy Terraform and observe resulting S3 misconfigurations                                   |
| 3    | Use AWS Config + CLI tools + tfsec to detect issues                                           |
| 4    | Investigate findings and create reports                                                       |
| 5    | Remediate Terraform templates to enforce best practices (encryption, private access, no ACLs) |
| 6    | Implement policy-as-code checks with OPA/Conftest or Sentinel                                 |
| 7    | Re-deploy and verify compliance                                                               |
| 8    | Write lessons learned and security best practices for IaC                                     |
