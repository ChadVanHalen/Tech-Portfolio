# üõ°Ô∏è Terraform Security Templates + S3 Misconfiguration Lab

## Overview
A hands-on lab focused on terraforming secure AWS infrastructure with an emphasis on detecting and remediating common misconfigurations, especially around S3 buckets (e.g., public exposure, lack of encryption, improper ACLs).

## Use Case
- Simulate insecure Terraform templates that provision S3 buckets with risky configurations (public read/write, missing encryption).
- Detect these misconfigurations using tools like AWS Config Rules, Terraform Sentinel (or open source alternatives), and Terraform plan/diff scanning tools.
- Investigate and remediate by updating Terraform code and applying secure templates.
- Teach secure IaC (Infrastructure as Code) practices to avoid cloud security missteps.

## Core Learning Objectives
- Learn Terraform basics with AWS resources.
- Identify S3 bucket misconfigurations via Terraform code and AWS scanning tools.
- Practice remediating insecure configurations in IaC before deployment.
- Understand continuous compliance via Terraform policy-as-code.

## Suggested Tools & Services
- Terraform CLI + AWS Provider
- AWS S3
- AWS Config Rules (managed rules for S3 bucket encryption, public access blocks)
- Terraform Sentinel (if licensed) or Open Policy Agent (OPA) + Conftest as open alternatives
- Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (optional, for policy enforcement)
- Static code analysis tools like tfsec, checkov, or terrascan

# üõ°Ô∏è Terraform Security Templates + S3 Misconfiguration Lab

## üìò Overview

This lab simulates common security misconfigurations in AWS S3 buckets using Terraform, and demonstrates how to detect, investigate, and remediate these issues using infrastructure-as-code best practices and native AWS tooling.

The goal is to build secure-by-default infrastructure while gaining hands-on experience with:

- Terraform provisioning
- S3 security risks
- Static code analysis
- Policy-as-code (OPA/Sentinel)
- AWS Config compliance

---

## üîç Use Case

Simulate the following insecure configurations via Terraform:

- Public S3 bucket access (ACLs or bucket policies)
- Lack of default encryption
- Versioning disabled
- Logging not enabled

Then, identify and fix them through detection tools and Terraform remediation.

---

## üíª Tools & Services Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Terraform** | Provision AWS resources (insecure vs. secure) |
| **AWS S3** | Target service for security misconfigurations |
| **AWS Config** | Detect non-compliant bucket configurations |
| **AWS CLI** | Inspect and verify configurations |

---

## üß≠ Steps

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Insecure Infrastructure | Use Terraform to create misconfigured S3 buckets |
| 2. Detect Misconfigurations | Use AWS Config and tfsec to identify violations |
| 3. Investigate | Review audit logs and code to trace risks |
| 4. Remediate | Update Terraform code to align with best practices |
| 5. Prevent Future Issues | Implement policy-as-code validation |
| 6. Lessons Learned | Summarize outcomes and security takeaways |
