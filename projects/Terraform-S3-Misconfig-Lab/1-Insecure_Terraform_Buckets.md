# üß® Chapter 1: Incident Simulation ‚Äì Unauthorized EC2 Launch for Crypto Mining

We‚Äôre kicking off this project by doing the one thing you're never supposed to do in production: misconfigure everything on purpose.

This chapter sets the stage for a simulated breach in AWS, using Terraform to spin up vulnerable infrastructure that mimics what happens when access control is lax, monitoring is absent, and someone thinks "*" is a good idea for IAM permissions.

## üéØ Goals

- Spin up an over-permissioned IAM user (terraform-crypto-actor)
- Create a public S3 bucket serving a file to the internet
- Open SSH to the world with a poorly locked-down security group
- Use that misconfigured user to launch and access an EC2 instance
- Generate enough bad behavior to trigger AWS-native detection tools later

## üõ†Ô∏è What Terraform Deployed

| Resource                            | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aws_iam_user`                      | User with full wildcard (`*:*`) permissions             |
| `aws_s3_bucket`                     | Publicly readable S3 bucket                             |
| `aws_s3_bucket_policy`              | Explicit public access to bucket objects                |
| `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` | Disabled safety features that would block public access |
| `aws_s3_object`                     | Uploaded an `index.html` file to act as exposed content |
| `aws_security_group`                | SSH wide open to the world (`0.0.0.0/0`)                |
| `aws_iam_user_login_profile`        | Console login manually granted for the attacker user    |

Terraform config is stored in the root directory, and all screenshots are collected under artifacts/.

## üõë What Went Wrong (On Purpose)

| Misconfiguration                      | Impact                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Over-permissioned IAM user**        | Total compromise risk: privilege escalation, resource abuse  |
| **Public S3 bucket**                  | Sensitive data could be exfiltrated without detection        |
| **ACLs and bucket policies disabled** | Circumvented AWS‚Äôs default protections                       |
| **World-open SSH access**             | Broad attack surface for brute force / remote code execution |
| **IAM user with console login**       | Full GUI access for attacker; nothing blocking this behavior |


# üîö Summary
This lab mirrors common entry points seen in real cloud incidents: exposed S3 buckets, overly broad IAM access, and remote server access via poorly configured security groups. You‚Äôll find similar conditions in a surprising number of leaked cloud breach reports.

The purpose of this chapter isn‚Äôt just chaos ‚Äî it‚Äôs to create signals we can detect later, like GuardDuty alerts, CloudTrail logs, and IAM misuse. That‚Äôs when the real IR work begins.

# üîú Next Up: Detection & Investigation
With our trap set, we‚Äôre ready to flip perspectives. In Chapter 2, we‚Äôll investigate what just happened ‚Äî simulating the defender side by analyzing GuardDuty findings, CloudTrail logs, and IAM behavior.
