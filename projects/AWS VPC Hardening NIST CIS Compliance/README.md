# AWS Cloud Security LabL NIST & CIS VPC Hardening  

## üîê Project Overview  
This project documents my hands-on journey to architect, deploy, and secure an enterprise-grade AWS VPC while aligning with **NIST 800-53** and **CIS AWS Benchmark** security standards.  

### Key Distinctions
- **Full Lifecycle Security**: Combines preventative, detective, and responsive controls across the entire VPC lifecycle.  
- **Modular Design**: Split into clear, progressive ‚Äústeps‚Äù that simulate real-world workflows‚Äîfrom segmentation to response.
- **Validation-Driven**: Each control is implemented and validated through AWS-native services and sandboxed attack simulations.

## üß≠ Compliance Focus  
This project maps hands-on AWS security implementations to key NIST and CIS benchmarks, including but not limited to:
- NIST 800-53: AC, SC, SI, IR, and AU families
- CIS AWS Foundations: Controls 1‚Äì5

Where possible, each step includes references to the specific controls being addressed.

---

## üìå Notes  
- This project was built using **free-tier AWS resources** to demonstrate low-cost compliance validation.
- All automation logic, screenshots, and testing were performed within a **sandbox environment** for safe experimentation.
