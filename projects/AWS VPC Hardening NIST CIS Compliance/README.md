# AWS Cloud Security Lab: GDPR, NIST, & CIS VPC Hardening  

## üîê Project Overview  
This lab project demonstrates the end-to-end design, deployment, and hardening of an enterprise-grade AWS VPC, aligned with key security frameworks:
- GDPR ‚Äì Technical safeguards for Articles 32‚Äì34 (data protection, breach detection, response)
- NIST 800-53 ‚Äì Across access control, audit, system integrity, and incident response families
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark ‚Äì Controls 1‚Äì5, including IAM, monitoring, data protection, and patching

## ‚úÖ What Makes This Project Unique
- **Full Lifecycle Security** ‚Äì From network segmentation and identity governance to detection and incident response
- **Modular & Reproducible** ‚Äì Each phase is isolated into logical ‚Äústeps‚Äù that mirror how enterprise teams implement controls
- **Hands-On Validation** ‚Äì Each security control is validated with live testing, from attack simulation to automated response
- **Cost-Conscious Compliance** ‚Äì All implementations tested using free-tier AWS, with limitations documented and workarounds explored

## üìå Notes  
- **Validated** - Each implementation was functionally tested (where AWS sandbox limits allowed), with logs and screenshots captured
- **Realistic** - Where true attack behavior couldn‚Äôt be triggered (e.g. GuardDuty sample findings), simulations were used to prove logic
- **Repeatable** - All configurations use AWS-native tools‚Äîready to scale or replicate in a real org
