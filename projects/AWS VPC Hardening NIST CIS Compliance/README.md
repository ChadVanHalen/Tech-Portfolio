# AWS VPC Hardening: NIST & CIS Compliance Implementation  

## Project Overview  
This project documents my hands-on journey to architect, deploy, and secure an enterprise-grade AWS VPC while aligning with **NIST 800-53** and **CIS AWS Benchmark** security standards.  

### Key Distinctions  
- **Scope**: Unlike my smaller-scope projects, this initiative combines multiple security objectives into a unified workflow.  
- **Structure**: Organized into modular "steps" for clear progression:  
  1. Network Segmentation (VPC/NACLs/Security Groups)  
  2. IAM Hardening (MFA/Least Privilege)  
  3. Monitoring & Compliance (GuardDuty/Flow Logs)
  4. Data Protection and Encryption
  5. Incident Response and Hardening

## Documentation Structure
