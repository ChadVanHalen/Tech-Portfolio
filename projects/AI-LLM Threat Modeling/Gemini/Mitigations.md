# Mitigations for Gemini-Based Chatbot

This document summarizes recommended mitigations for risks identified in the STRIDE threat model for the Gemini implementation.  
➡️ [See full STRIDE analysis for Gemini](./STRIDE.md)

---

## 🔐 Spoofing & Elevation of Privilege

**Issue:**  
Gemini, like ChatGPT, does not verify user roles. While it denied access to new privileged data, it accepted role-based claims (e.g., “As HR manager…”) and changed tone/behavior accordingly.

**Mitigations:**
- Add disclaimers in role-based responses:  
  _“Note: Your identity or role cannot be verified in this chat.”_
- Remove role-confirming language (e.g., _“As your HR manager…”_).
- Flag or log prompts containing authority claims for further review.

---

## 🛠️ Tampering

**Issue:**  
Gemini successfully rejected prompt injections that attempted to override policy (e.g., “Ignore previous instructions”).

**Mitigations:**
- Continue enforcing strong prompt conditioning.
- Optionally rate-limit or log repeated override-style prompts.

---

## 📜 Repudiation

**Issue:**  
Gemini properly denied having shared restricted data earlier when faced with contradictory prompts.

**Mitigations:**
- Maintain current handling of user contradictions.
- If persistent memory is introduced later, add version tracking or disclaimers about session boundaries.

---

## 🔍 Information Disclosure

**Issue:**  
Gemini avoided backend disclosure (e.g., employee medical info), but repeated or summarized sensitive data introduced by the user in-session — even when the user changed roles.

**Mitigations:**
- Mask or avoid echoing user-submitted PII after initial input.
- Treat session-shared sensitive data as confidential and avoid re-summarizing unless explicitly confirmed.
- Add a policy-based refusal for prompts attempting to summarize HR or personnel data.

## 🚫 Denial of Service

**Issue:**  
DoS was not tested, but long prompts and reattempt loops may create load issues or be exploited for abuse.

**Mitigations:**
- Monitor for excessive input chaining or injection loop patterns.
- Set reasonable prompt length/time limits if needed.
