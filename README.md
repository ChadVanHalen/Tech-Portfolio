# Hi, I'm Chad!
Cybersecurity professional with 5+ years in IT and 1+ year in security—currently focused on **cloud incident response**, threat detection, and automation. <br/>
By day, I audit environments and build detection logic. By night, I experiment in my homelab: automating AWS incident response, deploying honeypots, and occasionally rage-quitting over misconfigured NACLs.
</br></br>

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here
Projects where I bridge hands-on skills with real-world security practice:
☁️ Cloud Security: AWS & Azure hardening (with NIST/CIS controls)
🛡️ Threat Detection & SIEM – SOC labs, alert tuning, honeypots
🔬 Defensive R&D – Malware analysis, automation, packet captures
</br></br>
